\section{Research description}
\label{sec:research_description}
In Section~\ref{sec:domain} we discussed the transition to new electrical/electronics architectures in the automotive industry which are based on zone ECUs and a centralized control system. In this new architecture Time Sensitive Networking will be the main network technology for the future generation of vehicles. Section~\ref{sec:problem_statement} explained that the transition to a new architecture based on Time Sensitive Networking is non-trivial. We concluded that a solution capable of estimating a network's performance during the design process is necessary to reduce the risks of delay or cancellation of a project.
