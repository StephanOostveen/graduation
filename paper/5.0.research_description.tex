In Section~\ref{sec:domain} we discussed the transition to new electrical/electronics architectures in the automotive industry which are based on zone ECUs and a centralized control system. In this new architecture Time Sensitive Networking will be the main network technology for the future generation of vehicles. Section~\ref{sec:problem_statement} explained that the transition to a new architecture based on Time Sensitive Networking is non-trivial. We concluded that a solution capable of estimating a network's performance during the design process is necessary to reduce the risks of delay or cancellation of a project. The two most relevant solutions for determining network performance in the design phase are mathematical analysis and simulation. Various analysis methods exist but have a limited applicability due to the assumptions made. Specifically the implementation of the CAN bridge in the Lightyear 0 makes analysis of the network performance complex. Considering the popularity and availability of CAN and TSN models for \omnet, the decision was made to focus the research on an \omnet based simulation. In section~\ref{subsec:benchmark} we have seen that the available vehicle benchmarks either miss relevant data or do not fairly represent the Lightyear 0. For this reason we will research a method capable of extracting a model from source code that is abstract enough to make simulation feasible, but detailed enough to adequately answer performance questions at the system level. The remainder of this section is structured as follows: in section~\ref{sec:research_question} we refine Lightyear's problem from Section~\ref{sec:problem_statement}. Section~\ref{sec:research_contribution} describes the researcher's contribution to the problem of performance evaluation.
