\subsection{Real-time communication over Ethernet}
\label{sec:real-time-comm}
Some vehicle functions pose strict timing requirements on the architectures and implementations. For example the passenger safety system must always deploy the airbags within a specific time period after a crash. Deploying the airbags too quickly or too late can cause harm to the passengers. Similarly, when the driver presses the brake pedal in an electric vehicle the car should always stop accelerating, apply regenerative braking and illuminate the brake lights within a well-defined period of time. Large or non-deterministic variations in response time are undesirable from a safety and user experience point of view. Such systems with strict timing requirements are called real-time systems and require the timing properties to be bounded and analysable. 

Traditional automotive networks such as LIN, CAN and FlexRay support real-time communication, while IEEE 802.3 Ethernet is not a real-time network. One of the original design philosophies is best-effort transmission of frames~\cite{metcalfe1976ethernet}. Putting the responsibility of dealing with packet loss, duplication, large delays etc. on the communicating processes. This gives good average-case performance to a large group of users in an economically viable way, but sacrifices the real-time property.

The switches used in a full-duplex switched Ethernet network introduce a delay in the communication between two nodes. IEEE 802.3 does not specify how a switch should operate, hence in general no guarantee can be made about the queuing and switching delay added to the transmission time by a switch. Additionally, it is reasonable to assume that queuing delays increase as the number of packets passing through a switch increases. Making Ethernet unsuitable for use in a real-time system. 

Several higher level protocols have been proposed to make real-time communication on top of Ethernet possible e.g EtherCAT, PROFINET, TTEthernet and Time Sensitive Networking. Some of these protocols require special network interface cards or switches to operate, or they are not directly interoperable with \textit{standard} Ethernet, which complicates mixing the network other devices such as a computer using the TCP/IP stack.
