\todo{reflect hoe moeilijk/makkelijk het was om benchmark getallen naar boven te krijgen en hoe je dit op architectuur niveau makkelijker zou kunnen maken om te analyseren.}

Runnables with the same period deployed on a certain programmable end node have been grouped in a single task which is scheduled by the operating system, see Listing~\ref{lst:rtos_task} for an example. The runnables inside a task have been given a specific order in which they are executed. The reason for this deviation in the initial model or the reason for the specific order in which runnables are executed is unknown.

\todo{discuss the effect of this deviation for the results -> probably not such an issue as the runnables in a task have the same, but order in which they occur is semi random}
